# 🏛️ Claim Manager

A comprehensive legal case management application designed for managing claims, evidence, collaboration, and case workflows. Built with React, TypeScript, and Supabase.

- `claims` - Legal case information
- `evidence` - Evidence items and metadata
- `claim_shares` - Sharing relationships between users
- `todos` - Task management
- `calendar_events` - Calendar events
- `chat_messages` - Real-time messaging
- `subscribers` - User subscription information

### Security Policies
- Row Level Security (RLS) enabled on all tables
- Ownership-based access control
- Guest permission management
- Secure sharing mechanisms

## 🎯 Usage Guide

### Private vs Shared Claims

- **Private Claims**
  - Visible only to the claim owner
  - Full control over claim data, evidence, tasks, and calendar
  - Private To-Dos and Calendar are user-only and not visible to collaborators
  - Best for drafting, preparation, and personal workflows

- **Shared Claims**
  - Shared with specific collaborators via secure invitations
  - Ownership is retained by the Claim Owner (Broadcaster); guests cannot re‑share claims
  - Shared To-Dos and Calendar are scoped to the selected shared claim
  - Collaboration Hub is enabled (Chat, Video, Whiteboard)
  - Export in shared context only includes the selected shared claim’s data

### Private vs Shared To‑Dos and Calendar

- **Private To‑Dos**
  - Personal tasks not tied to sharing
  - Only the owner can view/manage
  - Ideal for owner’s own reminders and work items

- **Shared To‑Dos** (per shared claim)
  - Visible to all collaborators on that claim (subject to permissions)
  - Can assign tasks using `responsible_user_id`
  - Appears only when a shared claim is selected

- **Private Calendar**
  - Owner’s personal schedule
  - Not visible to collaborators

- **Shared Calendar** (per shared claim)
  - Events scoped to the selected shared claim
  - Can assign events using `responsible_user_id`
  - Displays to all collaborators with access

### Creating a Claim
1. Navigate to the main dashboard
2. Click "Add New Claim"
3. Fill in case details (case number, title, court, parties)
4. Set claim color and status
5. Save to create the claim

### Managing Evidence
1. Select a claim from the claims list
2. Navigate to the Evidence tab
3. Upload documents or add evidence items
4. Categorize and organize evidence
5. Link evidence to specific claims

### Sharing Claims
1. Select the claim you want to share
2. Click "Share Claim" button
3. Enter collaborator's email address
4. Set permissions (view/edit evidence, etc.)
5. Send invitation

### Collaboration
1. Access shared claims from the "Shared" tab
2. Use the Collaboration Hub for team communication
3. Start video calls for real-time discussion
4. Manage tasks and calendar events together
5. Only the Claim Owner (Broadcaster) can share/unshare and manage permissions; guests participate per granted permissions

### Video Conferencing (Daily.co or Google Meet)

- Integrated into the Collaboration Hub under the “Video Conference” tab
- Two provider options:
  - **Google Meet (Recommended, no API required)**: The Claim Owner (Broadcaster) can paste an existing Google Meet URL (created at `https://meet.google.com`). Collaborators see a prominent “Join Google Meet” button. No Google Calendar API is needed for this workflow.
  - **Daily.co (Built‑in video)**: If no Meet link is shared, the app falls back to the built‑in Daily.co video room.
- Daily.co rooms are auto‑named per claim: `claim-{claim-id}` and can be joined directly from the app
- Free tier note (Daily.co): while multiple participants are supported by the app, the Daily.co free plan effectively allows reliable 1‑to‑1 calls for up to 2 hours per day total usage. For multi‑party or longer sessions, consider upgrading your Daily.co plan.

### Collaborative Documents (ONLYOFFICE / Collabora / External)

- Integrated into the Collaboration Hub (owner tools in the Video tab)
- Claim Owner (Broadcaster) can paste an external document URL for collaborative editing
  - Recommended: **ONLYOFFICE Docs (Community Edition)** or **Collabora Online (CODE)**
  - You host the document server (Docker) and generate shareable edit links
  - Paste the link into the app; collaborators get an “Open Document” message/button
- Benefits
  - Real-time co-editing for .docx/.odt with familiar Office-like UI
  - No proprietary vendor lock-in; open-source options available
- Notes
  - Community editions are free but require your own server resources
  - For quick trials, you can paste any public document link; for secure editing, configure JWT/permissions on your doc server and share time-limited links
